I got a new Dell laptop with Ubuntu 16.04 preinstalled. I was _very_ annoyed by the fact that the super key is disabled by default. Dell provides a support page about how to enable that key here: http://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/4/HOW12108/en

In addition, I prefer to swap the Ctrl and CapsLock keys. The way to do it changes with _every_ Ubuntu releases. These are the instructions I followed: http://askubuntu.com/a/462498
